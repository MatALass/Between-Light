# Between Light

**2D Arcade Game Prototype (GameMaker Language)**

Between Light is a 2D arcade game prototype built using **GameMaker Language (GML)**.  
The game explores basic mechanics around **navigation, obstacles, and progression** in a visual environment.

---

## Game Concept

Between Light challenges the player to:

- Navigate through levels filled with obstacles
- Manage timing and movement
- Explore simple game mechanics with intuitive controls

This project focuses on game prototyping and implementation of core gameplay elements rather than polished level design.

---

## What I Did

- Built game logic using **GameMaker Language (GML)**
- Implemented player movement, collision detection, and obstacle behavior
- Structured game states (start, play, end)
- Designed visual elements and basic UI interaction
- Iterated on mechanics based on simple playtesting

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** GameMaker Language (GML)
- **Engine:** GameMaker Studio
- **Tools:** GameMaker IDE, sprites & tile editor

---

## How to Run

To play the game locally:

1. Download or clone the repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MatALass/personal-game-between-light.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **GameMaker Studio**
3. Run the game from the IDE

## Project Status

This is a **prototype** focused on mechanics rather than a complete game.  
Further improvements could include:
- Level progression
- Scoring system
- Sound effects and music
- Visual polish and animations

---

## What I Learned

- Game logic implementation in GML
- Basic game state management
- Collision detection & event systems
- Iterative testing of gameplay mechanics
